# Incorrect max accepted amount returned from the `BondBaseFPA.maxAmountAccepted` function (FPA Only)

## Summary

The `BondBaseFPA.maxAmountAccepted` return an incorrect max accepted amount.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `BondBaseFPA.maxAmountAccepted` function relies on the `BondBaseFPA.marketPrice` function to fetch the market price. The market price is expected to be in the price ratio of quote tokens per payout token (Q/P).

```solidity
File: BondBaseFPA.sol
369:     function maxAmountAccepted(uint256 id_, address referrer_) external view returns (uint256) {
370:         // Calculate maximum amount of quote tokens that correspond to max bond size
371:         // Maximum of the maxPayout and the remaining capacity converted to quote tokens
372:         BondMarket memory market = markets[id_];
373:         uint256 price = marketPrice(id_);
374:         uint256 quoteCapacity = market.capacityInQuote
375:             ? market.capacity
376:             : market.capacity.mulDiv(price, market.scale);
377:         uint256 maxQuote = market.maxPayout.mulDiv(price, market.scale);
378:         uint256 amountAccepted = quoteCapacity < maxQuote ? quoteCapacity : maxQuote;
379: 
380:         // Take into account teller fees and return
381:         // Estimate fee based on amountAccepted. Fee taken will be slightly larger than
382:         // this given it will be taken off the larger amount, but this avoids rounding
383:         // errors with trying to calculate the exact amount.
384:         // Therefore, the maxAmountAccepted is slightly conservative.
385:         uint256 estimatedFee = amountAccepted.mulDiv(
386:             _teller.getFee(referrer_),
387:             ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT
388:         );
389: 
390:         return amountAccepted + estimatedFee;
391:     }
```

However, due to a bug in the `BondBaseFPA.marketPrice` function, this function returns the price ratio of payout tokens per quote token (P/Q) instead of the ratio of quote tokens per payout token (Q/P). Refer to my other write-up titled "Incorrect market price returned from `BondBaseFPA.marketPrice` function (FPA Only)" on the bug in the `BondBaseFPA.marketPrice` function for more details. As a result, the max accepted amount computed will be incorrect.

## Impact

If any internal function within the protocol relies on the `BondBaseFPA.maxAmountAccepted` function, it will receive the wrong result, thus causing a computation error.

In addition, since this is a public function, any external or third-party protocol that integrates with this function would also suffer the same problem.

## Recommendation

Remediate the bug in the `BondBaseFPA.marketPrice` function and ensure that it returns the market price in the format of quote tokens per payout token (Q/P).
