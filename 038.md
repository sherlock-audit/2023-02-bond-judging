# Incorrect capacity calculation in BondBaseOSDA contract.

## Summary
The ```baseDiscount``` factor is not accounted for capacity  and causes the ```maxPayout``` to become larger.

## Vulnerability Detail
Inside the ```BondBaseOSDA._createMarket()``` function ,the protocol will calculate the maximum payout amount for this market. As the code below, if the value ```params_.capacityInQuote``` is true, the capacity will be ```params_.capacity.mulDiv(scale, price)```. Actually there is a ```baseDiscount``` for the ```BondBaseOSDA``` contract,this factor is not accounted for and causes the ```maxPayout``` to become larger.

```solidity
     uint256 capacity = params_.capacityInQuote
            ? params_.capacity.mulDiv(scale, price)
            : params_.capacity;
        market.maxPayout = capacity.mulDiv(uint256(params_.depositInterval), uint256(length));
```

## Impact
The ```baseDiscount``` factor is not accounted for capacity  and causes the ```maxPayout``` to become larger.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
like this:
```solidity
     uint256 capacity = params_.capacityInQuote
            ? params_.capacity.mulDiv(
                scale,
                price.mulDivUp(
                    uint256(ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT - params_.baseDiscount),
                    uint256(ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT)
                )
            )
            : params_.capacity;
```
