# Incorrect payout amount returned from the `BondBaseFPA.payoutFor` function (FPA only)

## Summary

The `BondBaseFPA.payoutFor` return an incorrect payout amount.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `BondBaseFPA.payoutFor` function relies on the `BondBaseFPA.marketPrice` function to fetch the market price. The market price is expected to be in the price ratio of quote tokens per payout token (Q/P).

```solidity
File: BondBaseFPA.sol
350:     function payoutFor(
351:         uint256 amount_,
352:         uint256 id_,
353:         address referrer_
354:     ) public view override returns (uint256) {
355:         // Calculate the payout for the given amount of tokens
356:         uint256 fee = amount_.mulDiv(_teller.getFee(referrer_), ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT);
357:         uint256 payout = (amount_ - fee).mulDiv(markets[id_].scale, marketPrice(id_));
358: 
359:         // Check that the payout is less than or equal to the maximum payout,
360:         // Revert if not, otherwise return the payout
361:         if (payout > markets[id_].maxPayout) {
362:             revert Auctioneer_MaxPayoutExceeded();
363:         } else {
364:             return payout;
365:         }
366:     }
```

However, due to a bug in the `BondBaseFPA.marketPrice` function, this function returns the price ratio of payout tokens per quote token (P/Q) instead of the ratio of quote tokens per payout token (Q/P). Refer to my other write-up titled "Incorrect market price returned from `BondBaseFPA.marketPrice` function (FPA Only)" on the bug in the `BondBaseFPA.marketPrice` function for more details. As a result, the `payout` computed will be incorrect.

## Impact

If any internal function within the protocol relies on the `BondBaseFPA.payoutFor` function, it will receive the wrong result, thus causing computation error, which could potentially lead to loss of assets if it uses the incorrect result to determine the number of payout tokens to be issued (e.g. less payout token being issued to users).

In addition, since this is a public function, any external or third-party protocol that integrates with this function would also suffer the same problem.

## Recommendation

Remediate the bug in the `BondBaseFPA.marketPrice` function and ensure that it returns the market price in the format of quote tokens per payout token (Q/P).
