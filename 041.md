# Users can avoid the max payout limit for FPA and OFDA auction types

## Summary

The OSDA auction type updates the sale price of a bond after each sale. However the price of the next sale is only dependent on previous sales. For a sale at time `t` only the actions taken in time `[0,t-1]` are considered. To avoid a buyer at time `t` making an outsized impact based on the previous state, a `maxPayout` parameter was introduced.  This way buyers have to split large orders into several, allowing for state updates to occur within the order.

However, the FPA and OFDA auction types have no such dependence between price and previous sales. For these auctions, the maxPayout parameter only causes the buyer to waste gas as making two identical orders will use the same price as just making one order twice as large.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `maxPayout` parameter in FPA and OFDA auctions can be avoided by simply making many transactions in between oracle updates. This is an identical operation to just removing the `maxPayout` parameter from these auction types altogether.
