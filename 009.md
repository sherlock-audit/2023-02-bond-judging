# Callback contract metamorphic attack possible

## Summary
callback contract metamorphic attack possible

## Vulnerability Detail
Whitelist for callback contract is needed in order to enable custom callback contract for a bond. However once the callback contract is whitelisted, the owner of the callback contract can exercise metamorphic attack, namely destruct the contract and replace it with a new different contract bytecode on the same address. This destroies the purpose of whitelisting.

## Impact
whitelisting becomes ineffective. The impact of an unknown callback has to be further understood with reference to the criteria under which a callback contract is approved.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Consider storing a hash of the contract bytecode to make sure it's the version that is whitelisted, check this hash during making the callback.
