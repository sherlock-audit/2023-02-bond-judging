# The initiateBatchAuction transaction could fail

## Summary
The protocol misses check that if the minted bond tokens is less than the ```batchAuctionParams_.liquidityAmount``` , it could lead the transaction to fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
The ```BondBatchAuctionV1.initiateBatchAuction()``` function is used to initiate auction. 
The protocol first validates bond token params.
Then, deploy Bond Token (checks exist on the teller to see if it already exists).
Next, transfer underlying token from owner to ```address(this)``` and call the ```teller().create()``` to mint bond tokens.
After that,send the bond tokens reserved to provide liquidity to the sender if ```batchAuctionParams_.liquidityAmount > 0```. The ```batchAuctionParams_.liquidityAmount``` comes from the parameters passed by the user.
 Here is the probolem, if the minted bond tokens is less than the ```batchAuctionParams_.liquidityAmount```, the transaction will fail.
```solidity
 if (batchAuctionParams_.liquidityAmount > 0)
                payoutToken.safeTransfer(owner(), uint256(batchAuctionParams_.liquidityAmount));
        }
```
## Impact
 If the minted bond tokens is less than the ```batchAuctionParams_.liquidityAmount```, the transaction will fail.
