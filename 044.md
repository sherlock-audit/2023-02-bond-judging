# Removing support for a currency pair from the oracle leaves markets in an invalid state

## Summary

When a new market is registered in the Bond Oracle, it is checked that that market's currencies are supported by the oracle. If not, then the transaction reverts.

However, when a currency pair is later set to be unsupported due to an issue, markets with that pair are not unregistered. This breaks the invariant that all registered markets use supported currencies.

In fact, there is actually no way for an owner to unregister a market at all.

## Vulnerability Detail

Market operations on registered markets with unsupported tokens will attempts calls to `address(0)`, causing unexpected results for oracle operations

## Impact

Unexpected state for markets, potentially causing unexplained DoS.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Provide a mechanism for unregistering a market from the oracle. In addition, add auto-unregistering for markets using newly unsupported currency pairs.
