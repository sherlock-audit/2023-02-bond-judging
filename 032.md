# Incorrect calculation of fees in amount variable

## Summary
The calculation of  `amount` variable is incorrect, as it adds the fees for both the auction and the teller to the auction and liquidity amounts. This could result in the calculation of an incorrect amount, which could cause unexpected behavior in the auction or teller contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-bond/blob/main/bonds/src/BondBatchAuctionV1.sol#L129 

Assume, we have an auction contract and a teller contract, and we want to execute a trade where the buyer buys 100 tokens from the seller.

The auction contract charges a 1% fee on the trade, while the teller contract charges a 2% fee.

If the calculation of `amount` variable is incorrect and adds the fees for both contracts to  `auction ` and `liquidity` `amounts`, 
then the calculation will be as follows:

- Auction amount: 100 tokens
- Auction fee: 1 token (1% of 100 tokens)
- Liquidity amount: 100 tokens
- Liquidity fee: 2 tokens (2% of 100 tokens)
- Total amount: 203 tokens (100 tokens + 1 token + 100 tokens + 2 tokens)

However, the correct calculation should only add the fees to `amount` that is paid by the buyer. 
Therefore, the correct calculation should be:

- Auction amount: 100 tokens
- Auction fee: 1 token (1% of 100 tokens)
- Liquidity amount: 100 tokens
- Liquidity fee: 2 tokens (2% of 100 tokens)
- Total amount: 103 tokens (100 tokens + 1 token + 2 tokens)


## Impact
If the incorrect calculation is used, it could result in unexpected behavior in the auction or teller contracts, such as incorrect token balances or failed trades. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the calculation of the `amount` variable is correct and takes into account only the fees that are paid by the buyer.

## Recommendation

Separate the calculation of auction fees and teller fees from the calculation of `amount`. This will ensure that the fees are not mistakenly added to the amount, leading to incorrect calculations.
