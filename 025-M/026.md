# Inconsistencies within the `payoutFor` function

## Summary

Inconsistencies within the `payoutFor` function were observed. The function does not revert when there is insufficient capacity for the number of payout tokens they are expected to receive when depositing a certain number of quote tokens. This gives the caller an incorrect state of the current market.

## Vulnerability Detail

> This issue affects FPA, OFDA, and OSDA

Within the `purchaseBond` function, the function will revert, and the users will not be able to purchase the bond when any of the conditions is met:

- The payout exceeds the max payout
- Amount/payout is greater than the capacity remaining

```solidity
File: BondBaseFPA.sol
262:     function purchaseBond(
263:         uint256 id_,
264:         uint256 amount_,
265:         uint256 minAmountOut_
266:     ) external override returns (uint256 payout) {
..SNIP
286:         // Markets have a max payout amount per transaction
287:         if (payout > market.maxPayout) revert Auctioneer_MaxPayoutExceeded();
..SNIP..
297:         // If amount/payout is greater than capacity remaining, revert
298:         if (market.capacityInQuote ? amount_ > market.capacity : payout > market.capacity)
299:             revert Auctioneer_NotEnoughCapacity();
300:         // Capacity is decreased by the deposited or paid amount
301:         market.capacity -= market.capacityInQuote ? amount_ : payout;
..SNIP..
307:     }
```

It was observed that there are some inconsistencies within the `payoutFor` function. The function will revert when the payout exceeds the max payout. However, it does not revert if the amount/payout is greater than the capacity remaining.

```solidity
File: BondBaseFPA.sol
350:     function payoutFor(
351:         uint256 amount_,
352:         uint256 id_,
353:         address referrer_
354:     ) public view override returns (uint256) {
355:         // Calculate the payout for the given amount of tokens
356:         uint256 fee = amount_.mulDiv(_teller.getFee(referrer_), ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT);
357:         uint256 payout = (amount_ - fee).mulDiv(markets[id_].scale, marketPrice(id_));
358: 
359:         // Check that the payout is less than or equal to the maximum payout,
360:         // Revert if not, otherwise return the payout
361:         if (payout > markets[id_].maxPayout) {
362:             revert Auctioneer_MaxPayoutExceeded();
363:         } else {
364:             return payout;
365:         }
366:     }
```

Assume the following:

- maxPayout = 100 Bond Tokens (DAI)
- market.capacity = 50 Bond Tokens (DAI) left
- payout = 70 Bond Tokens (DAI) should be issued to the users

Assume that Alice calls the `payoutFor` function for a certain amount of quote tokens. The function will return `70 Bond Tokens (DAI)` and will not revert because `payout` is lower than the `maxPayout`.

This makes Alice believe she can obtain `70 Bond Tokens (DAI)` if she calls the `purchaseBond` function. However, when she calls the `purchaseBond` function, the function reverts because of insufficient capacity.

## Impact

Inconsistencies within the protocol can cause various issues, especially for the external or third-party protocol that relies on protocol's interfaces to determine the correct state of the protocol they are integrating with. Also, callers relying on the `payoutFor` result might wrongly assume that their `purchaseBond` transaction will go through when there is insufficient capacity, incurring unnecessary delay or missed opportunity during trading.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the `payoutFor` function to revert when there is insufficient capacity.

```diff
function payoutFor(
    uint256 amount_,
    uint256 id_,
    address referrer_
) public view override returns (uint256) {
    // Calculate the payout for the given amount of tokens
    uint256 fee = amount_.mulDiv(_teller.getFee(referrer_), ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT);
    uint256 payout = (amount_ - fee).mulDiv(markets[id_].scale, marketPrice(id_));

    // Check that the payout is less than or equal to the maximum payout,
    // Revert if not, otherwise return the payout
    if (payout > markets[id_].maxPayout) {
        revert Auctioneer_MaxPayoutExceeded();
+   } else if (market[id_].capacityInQuote ? amount_ > market[id_].capacity : payout > market[id_].capacity) {
+		revert Auctioneer_NotEnoughCapacity();
    } else {
        return payout;
    }
}
