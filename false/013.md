# Array size could result in DoS making function unavailable

## Summary
Due to the fact that the protocol is permission less and an "endless" amount of markets can be created, it can block functions that loop threw all markets.

## Vulnerability Detail
`marketsFor()`, `findMarketFor()` and `liveMarketsFor()` all eventually loop over the mapping `marketsForPayout` and `marketsForQuote`. When this gets too big it could result in denial of service making all these functions or functions that will interact with fail. 

I'm guessing that these functions are used for displaying e.g. "the market ID with the highest current payoutToken payout for depositing quoteToken" which will break.
## Impact
While this may not cause a major issue for the protocol, it  will be building on top of this feature without expecting this behavior. These functions might create a vulnerability.  
If functionality is added (which uses one of these functions) by creating a new contract and an audit is performed on that contract, the BondAggregator.sol will likely be out of scope. This might cause this issue to be missed and create a vulnerability.

## Recommendation
Consider removing markets from the array when they are concluded.
