# No way to remove auctioneer

## Summary
The protocol don't have logic to remove vulnerable auctioneer. 

## Vulnerability Detail
[BondAggregator.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-bond/blob/main/bonds/src/BondAggregator.sol#L62-L72) has a whitelist mechanism, but no function to remove the whitelist `auctioneer`.

```solidity
function registerAuctioneer(IBondAuctioneer auctioneer_) external requiresAuth {
        // Restricted to authorized addresses
  
        // Check that the auctioneer is not already registered
        if (_whitelist[address(auctioneer_)])
            revert Aggregator_AlreadyRegistered(address(auctioneer_));

        // Add the auctioneer to the whitelist
        auctioneers.push(auctioneer_);
        _whitelist[address(auctioneer_)] = true;
    }
```

Once an `auctioneer` address has been added to the whitelist, it is not possible to remove him from the whitelist. 
The vault address may be compromised and need to be removed. It is therefore important to create a mechanism  from which one can remove the whitelist `auctioneer` address.
Also is possible admin accidentally whitelisted the wrong auctioneer, there is no way to remove it.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-bond/blob/main/bonds/src/BondAggregator.sol#L62-L72
```solidity
function registerAuctioneer(IBondAuctioneer auctioneer_) external requiresAuth {
        // Restricted to authorized addresses
  
        // Check that the auctioneer is not already registered
        if (_whitelist[address(auctioneer_)])
            revert Aggregator_AlreadyRegistered(address(auctioneer_));

        // Add the auctioneer to the whitelist
        auctioneers.push(auctioneer_);
        _whitelist[address(auctioneer_)] = true;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It's better to implementing an additional function or logic to allow the removal of an auctioneer from the whitelist.
