# Incorrect payout computation (FPA Only)

## Summary

Due to incorrect payout computation within the FPA, the users will receive fewer payout tokens than expected, leading to a loss of assets.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `MarketParams.formattedPrice` is the price ratio of payout tokens per quote token (P/Q) as per Line 31 below. This means the number of payout tokens for every single quote token (e.g. Payout tokens/Quote token)

```solidity
File: IBondFPA.sol
29:     /// @notice             Parameters to create a new bond market
30:     /// @dev                Note price should be passed in a specific format:
31:     ///                     formatted price = (payoutPriceCoefficient / quotePriceCoefficient)
32:     ///                             * 10**(36 + scaleAdjustment + quoteDecimals - payoutDecimals + payoutPriceDecimals - quotePriceDecimals)
33:     ///                     where:
34:     ///                         payoutDecimals - Number of decimals defined for the payoutToken in its ERC20 contract
35:     ///                         quoteDecimals - Number of decimals defined for the quoteToken in its ERC20 contract
36:     ///                         payoutPriceCoefficient - The coefficient of the payoutToken price in scientific notation (also known as the significant digits)
37:     ///                         payoutPriceDecimals - The significand of the payoutToken price in scientific notation (also known as the base ten exponent)
38:     ///                         quotePriceCoefficient - The coefficient of the quoteToken price in scientific notation (also known as the significant digits)
39:     ///                         quotePriceDecimals - The significand of the quoteToken price in scientific notation (also known as the base ten exponent)
40:     ///                         scaleAdjustment - see below
41:     ///                         * In the above definitions, the "prices" need to have the same unit of account (i.e. both in OHM, $, ETH, etc.)
42:     ///                         If price is not provided in this format, the market will not behave as intended.
..SNIP..
49:     /// @dev                    5. Formatted price (see note above)
..SNIP..
58:     struct MarketParams {
59:         ERC20 payoutToken;
60:         ERC20 quoteToken;
61:         address callbackAddr;
62:         bool capacityInQuote;
63:         uint256 capacity;
64:         uint256 formattedPrice;
65:         uint48 vesting;
66:         uint48 conclusion;
67:         uint48 depositInterval;
68:         int8 scaleAdjustment;
69:     }
```

The `market.price` is set to the `MarketParams.formattedPrice` during initialization.

The `amount_` is denominated in quote tokens and represents the amount of quote tokens the buyer deposited into the protocol in exchange for payout tokens (Bond Token).

```solidity
File: BondBaseFPA.sol
262:     function purchaseBond(
263:         uint256 id_,
264:         uint256 amount_,
265:         uint256 minAmountOut_
266:     ) external override returns (uint256 payout) {
..SNIP..
280:         // Calculate payout amount from fixed price
281:         payout = amount_.mulDiv(market.scale, market.price);
```

It was observed that the formula at Line 281 above is incorrect. Let `P` be the payout token and `Q` be the quote token.

Recall that the `market.price` is the price ratio of payout tokens per quote token (P/Q). Assume the price is 5P per 1Q (e.g. 5)

Alice deposit 10Q tokens into the protocol, thus the `amount_` will be set to `10`.

Alice is supposed to receive 50P in return. However, she receives only 2P as shown below.

```solidity
payout = amount_.mulDiv(market.scale, market.price);
payout = amount_ / market.price (simplified - ignoring the scaling)
payout = 10Q / (5P / 1Q)
payout = 2
```

The correct formula is to divide the `_amount` by the price ratio of quote tokens per payout token (Q/P) instead of price ratio of payout tokens per quote token (P/Q).

## Impact

Loss of assets for the users as they receive fewer payout tokens than expected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In the original SDA contract, it relies on the `marketPrice` function to retrieve the market price instead of relying on the `MarketParams.formattedPrice` variable directly.

The `marketPrice` function will return correct pricing in quote tokens per payout token (e.g. Q/P).

```solidity
File: IBondFPA.sol
81:     /* ========== VIEW FUNCTIONS ========== */
82: 
83:     /// @notice             Calculate current market price of payout token in quote tokens
84:     /// @param id_          ID of market
85:     /// @return             Price for market in configured decimals (see MarketParams)
86:     /// @dev price is derived from the equation:
87:     //
88:     // p = f_p
89:     //
90:     // where
91:     // p = price
92:     // f_p = fixed price provided on creation
93:     //
94:     function marketPrice(uint256 id_) external view override returns (uint256);
```

Consider updating the formula as follows:

```diff
function purchaseBond(
    uint256 id_,
    uint256 amount_,
    uint256 minAmountOut_
) external override returns (uint256 payout) {
..SNIP..
    // Calculate payout amount from fixed price
-   payout = amount_.mulDiv(market.scale, market.price);
+   payout = amount_.mulDiv(market.scale, marketPrice(id_));
```
