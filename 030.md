# minPrice Can Be 0 If maxDiscountFromCurrent Is Set To ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT

## Summary
The minPrice of bonds can be 0 if maxDiscountFromCurrent is set to ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT. 
Thus, the bonds don't have a minimum price, and if the discounted price keeps going down, the market maker will lose a large amount of money due to the unexpectedly low price.
## Vulnerability Detail
When `maxDiscountFromCurrent` is accidentally set to 1e5 ( which might be a typo for 1e4), then `maxDiscountFromCurrent` will bypass the check and `term.minPrice` will be 0 as 0 divides 1e5.

## Impact
In the event that the maxDicountFromCurrent is set wrongly, the discounted price can keep reaching down without a floor, and if that happens, the fatest taker will extract as many payout tokens as possible before reaching the `maxPayout` limit from the market. Taker gain is maker loss.

## Recommendation
consider disallowing max discount to be ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT or hard code a min price.
