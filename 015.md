# BondBaseOFDA.purchaseBond might become unavailable if ownership is transferred

## Summary
If ownership is transferred, purchasing bondtokens via purchaseBond() might become unavailable due to the check `if (market.callbackAddr != address(0) && !callbackAuthorized[market.owner])
            revert Auctioneer_NotAuthorized();`
## Vulnerability Detail
When *Teller.sol calls BondBase*.purchaseBond there's a check to ensure that the `market.owner` is `callbackAuthorized`. If that's not the case the function reverts.

If the market uses a callback address and the owner decides to transfers ownership, pruchaseBond will revert all the time making the market unavailable. This is due to the fact that the new owner is not added in callbackAuthorized.

## Impact
No one is able to purchase tokens after ownership is transferred.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You could either 
1. Add the new owner to be added to `callbackAuthorized` when pulling ownership https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-bond/blob/main/bonds/src/bases/BondBaseOFDA.sol#L291
2. Add a check in `pushOwnership()` that reverts if new owner is not in `callbackAuthorized`
