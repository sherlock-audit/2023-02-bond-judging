# _validateAndGetPrice() doesn't check If Arbitrum sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds

## Summary
When utilizing Chainlink in L2 chains like Arbitrum, it's important to ensure that the prices provided are not falsely perceived as fresh, even when the sequencer is down. This vulnerability could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no check: 
```soldity
solidity function _validateAndGetPrice(AggregatorV2V3Interface feed_, uint48 updateThreshold_)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256)
    {
        // Get latest round data from feed
        (uint80 roundId, int256 priceInt, , uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = feed_
            .latestRoundData();
        // @audit check if Arbitrum L2 sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds: medium
        // Validate chainlink price feed data
        // 1. Answer should be greater than zero
        // 2. Updated at timestamp should be within the update threshold
        // 3. Answered in round ID should be the same as the round ID
        if (
            priceInt <= 0 ||
            updatedAt < block.timestamp - uint256(updateThreshold_) ||
            answeredInRound != roundId
        ) revert BondOracle_BadFeed(address(feed_));
        return uint256(priceInt);
    }
```
## Impact
could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage.
