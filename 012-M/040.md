# Auctioneers constructors don't check if teller is of the same type

## Summary

All functions `constructor` does not check if input `teller` is of the same type as the market. Consequently, someone might deploy for example a Fixed Term market using a Fixed Expiry Teller either by accident or with malicious intent.  

**The risk here is that the code will not revert and user can just purchase bond like normal but all markets' behaviors are different without the awareness of both market owners and bond buyers**

 
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's say for example a Fixed Term FPA market is created using a Fixed Expiry Teller; the result would be all markets become 
instant swap instead of fixed term bond markets.

1. The constructor in auctioneer looks likes
```solidity
constructor(
        IBondTeller teller_,
        IBondAggregator aggregator_,
        address guardian_,
        Authority authority_
    ) BondBaseFPA(teller_, aggregator_, guardian_, authority_) {}
```
Since the constructor uses `IBondTeller`, both Fixed Expiry Teller and Fixed Term Teller could be used to initialize the auctioneer.

2. After the auctioneer is deployed, Alice creates a fixed term market with `vesting` = 7 days
3. If Bob then purchases bond, the function `_handlePayout` of `BondFixedExpiryTeller` will be executed, the function is as follow:
```solidity
        if (vesting_ > uint48(block.timestamp)) {
            expiry = vesting_;
            // Fixed-expiry bonds mint ERC-20 tokens
            bondTokens[underlying_][expiry].mint(recipient_, payout_);
        } else {
            // If no expiry, then transfer payout directly to user
            underlying_.safeTransfer(recipient_, payout_);
        }
```
 Because `vesting_` always < block.timestamp in fixed term market; function `_handlePayout` will always immediately transfer payout token to recipient; effectively become an instant swap market.

## Impact
- The code will not revert and market behaviors are different without the awareness of the market owners, bond buyers or even the auctioneer deploy

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend checking in each constructor if the teller input is of the same type with the auctioneer being created.
