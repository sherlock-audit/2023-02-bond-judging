# Not calling approve(0) before setting a new approval causes the call to revert when used with tether(USDT)

## Summary
Some tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. They must first be approved by zero and then the actual allowance must be approved.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens do not implement the ERC20 standard properly but are still accepted by most code that accepts ERC20 tokens. For example Tether (USDT)‘s `approve()` function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.

## Impact
The code as currently implemented does not handle these sorts of tokens properly when they’re a Uniswap pool asset, which would prevent USDT, the sixth largest pool, from being used by this project.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-bond/blob/main/bonds/src/BondBatchAuctionV1.sol#L151

```solidity
batchAuctionParams_.payoutTokenParams.underlying.approve(address(teller()), amount);
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-bond/blob/main/bonds/src/BondBatchAuctionV1.sol#L167-L171

```solidity
 payoutToken.approve(
                address(gnosisAuction()),
                (uint256(batchAuctionParams_.auctionAmount) *
                    (gnosisAuction().feeNumerator() + feeDecimals)) / feeDecimals
            );
```

## Recommendation
Use OpenZeppelin’s `SafeERC20`'s `safeTransfer()` instead
