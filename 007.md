# frontrun attack of `deploy()` in `BondFixedExpiryTeller` due to create() would continue even though there is pre-existing contract

## Summary
frontrunning deploy() in `BondFixedExpiryTeller` would be still added as a valid bondToken.

## Vulnerability Detail
`deploy(ERC20 underlying_, uint48 expiry_)` would create a  proxy contract that points to the `ERC20BondToken` implementation. The address of the proxy is computed using the specific calldata that is derived from the underlying token and expiry, as well as nonce + address of factory according to specification of create(). 

However in the function `clone()` the create() call would not be reverted if the address is pre-existed. Thus a pre-existed address would still be assigned to the mapping `bondTokens` during `deploy()`; External call would be made to this address during `create()` and `redeem()`


## Impact
During `create()`, the Teller would call `mint()` on the external bondToken address directly; if this bondToken is not the implementation specified then essentially the attacker can wipe out all the assets in the Teller. Similar arugment for `redeem`

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. If the proxy address is pre-existed, consider fail or revert the call.
2. Use create2 with the inclusion of the address of the tx sender to make the proxy address harder to replicate
