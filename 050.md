# Not calling approve(0) before setting a new approval causes the call to revert when used with certain Tokens such as Tether - USDT

## Summary
Some tokens do not implement the ERC20 standard properly but are still accepted by most code that accepts ERC20 tokens. For example Tether (USDT)‘s `approve()` function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.

## Vulnerability Detail

The code as currently implemented does not handle these sorts of tokens properly when they’re a Uniswap pool asset, which would prevent USDT, the sixth largest pool, from being used by this project. This project relies heavily on Uniswap, so this would hamper future growth and availability of the protocol.

The following areas in the code need to approve(0) first, else the transaction will be reverted

```solidity
batchAuctionParams_.payoutTokenParams.underlying.approve(address(teller()), amount)
```

```solidity
            payoutToken.approve(
                address(gnosisAuction()),
                (uint256(batchAuctionParams_.auctionAmount) *
                    (gnosisAuction().feeNumerator() + feeDecimals)) / feeDecimals
            );
```

## Recommendation
Approve with a zero amount first before setting the actual amount.
