# Malicious user can Blacklists Token

## Summary
The protocol currently uses any ERC20 tokens.

Some tokens (e.g. USDC, USDT) have a contract level admin controlled address blacklist. If an address is blocked, then transfers to and from that address are forbidden.

## Vulnerability Detail
There are currently 200+ blacklisted accounts by USDC, these accounts are related to known hacks and other crime events.

## Impact
For example check `withdraw()` in [BondBaseCallback.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-bond/blob/main/bonds/src/bases/BondBaseCallback.sol#L150-L157) or function `claimFees()` in [BondBaseTeller.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-bond/blob/main/bonds/src/bases/BondBaseTeller.sol#L108-L119). Malicious or compromised token owners can trap funds in a contract by adding the contract address to the blocklist.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Try to implement a try-catch solution where you skip certain funds whenever they cause the USDC transfer to revert.
