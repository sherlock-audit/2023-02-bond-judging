# liveMarketsBetween reverts if lastIndex_ is out of marketsToAuctioneers length

## Summary
When the lastIndex_ parameter of liveMarketsBetween() is bigger than marketsCounter, isLive(id_) reverts which cause bad UX.

## Vulnerability Detail

To show live markets at Frontend, there is liveMarketsBetween which accepts firstIndex_ and lastIndex_. It can be used for pagination and some other purposes.
But as isLive() doesn't check the id_ is under length and marketsToAuctioneers[id_] is valid, it reverts the entire transaction, which causes bad UX and should have been showing available markets instead.


## Impact
Bad User Experience


## Code Snippet

```solidity
  function isLive(uint256 id_) public view override returns (bool) {
      IBondAuctioneer auctioneer = marketsToAuctioneers[id_];
      return auctioneer.isLive(id_);
  }
```

## Recommendation
```solidity
  function isLive(uint256 id_) public view override returns (bool) {
      IBondAuctioneer auctioneer = marketsToAuctioneers[id_];
      if (address(auctioneer) == address(0)) 
          return false;
      return auctioneer.isLive(id_);
  }
