# Incorrect max payout returned from the `BondBaseFPA.maxPayout` function (FPA Only)

## Summary

The `BondBaseFPA.maxPayout` return an incorrect max payout.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `BondBaseFPA.maxPayout` function relies on the `BondBaseFPA.marketPrice` function to fetch the market price. The market price is expected to be in the price ratio of quote tokens per payout token (Q/P).

```solidity
File: BondBaseFPA.sol
394:     function maxPayout(uint256 id_) external view override returns (uint256) {
395:         // Get current price
396:         uint256 price = marketPrice(id_);
397: 
398:         BondMarket memory market = markets[id_];
399: 
400:         // Convert capacity to payout token units for comparison with max payout
401:         uint256 capacity = market.capacityInQuote
402:             ? market.capacity.mulDiv(market.scale, price)
403:             : market.capacity;
404: 
405:         // Cap max payout at the remaining capacity
406:         return market.maxPayout > capacity ? capacity : market.maxPayout;
407:     }
```

However, due to a bug in the `BondBaseFPA.marketPrice` function, this function returns the price ratio of payout tokens per quote token (P/Q) instead of the ratio of quote tokens per payout token (Q/P). Refer to my other write-up titled "Incorrect market price returned from `BondBaseFPA.marketPrice` function (FPA Only)" on the bug in the `BondBaseFPA.marketPrice` function for more details. As a result, the max payout computed will be incorrect.

## Impact

If any internal function within the protocol relies on the `BondBaseFPA.maxPayout` function, it will receive the wrong result, thus causing a computation error.

In addition, since this is a public function, any external or third-party protocol that integrates with this function would also suffer the same problem.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remediate the bug in the `BondBaseFPA.marketPrice` function and ensure that it returns the market price in the format of quote tokens per payout token (Q/P).
